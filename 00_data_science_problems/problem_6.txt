This problem was asked by Google.

A coin was flipped 1000 times, and 550 times it showed up heads. Do you think the coin is biased? Why or why not?

- no, because 50% is in the large scale lens, having 1000 times does not mean it will give 550 time head.
- each flip is independent and does not have any connection to the previous flip
