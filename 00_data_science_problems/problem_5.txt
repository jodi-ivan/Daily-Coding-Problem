This problem was asked by Facebook.

Assume you have the below tables on user actions. Write a query to get the active user retention by month.

user_actions
column_name	type
user_id	integer
event_id	string ("sign-in", "like", "comment")
timestamp	datetime



MY solution: 
-- Select user_id, month_date, count(*) from table group by user_id, CONCAT(YEAR(datetime), "-", MONTH(date_time))
WITH monthly_active_users AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        CONCAT(YEAR(timestamp), "-", MONTH(timestamp)) AS month_date
    FROM 
        user_actions
    GROUP BY 
        user_id, 
        month_date
),
user_retention AS (
    SELECT 
        mu1.month_date AS month_active,
        COUNT(DISTINCT mu1.user_id) AS retained_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT mu2.user_id) AS total_retained
    FROM 
        monthly_active_users mu1
    LEFT JOIN 
        monthly_active_users mu2 ON mu1.user_id = mu2.user_id 
                                   AND DATE_FORMAT(mu2.month_date, '%Y-%m') = DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(mu1.month_date, INTERVAL 1 MONTH), '%Y-%m')
    GROUP BY 
        mu1.month_date
)

SELECT 
    month_active,
    retained_count,
    (retained_count / total_retained) * 100 AS retention_rate
FROM 
    user_retention
WHERE 
    total_retained > 0
ORDER BY 
    month_active;
